All of the functions are located in the functions.py program.
The other programs imports the necessary functions as needed. 

Run the functions.py program in order to compute the age of the 
Universe at T=10e10 K, T=10e9 K, and T=10e8 K.

All of the programs (except functions.py) saves figures to the 
figures/ folder. 

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The programs fitting_*.py stores the needed arrays as .npy arrays.
They are then imported into the plot_best_params.py program, and
are therefore needed before running the program. It takes about 
20 min to run each program.
